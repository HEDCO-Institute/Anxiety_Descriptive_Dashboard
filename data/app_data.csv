Thirty-five elementary school principals (K–7) in the participating large suburban school district were invited to enroll in this research project via a presentation on the research project at the school board district office in June 2004. Of the 35 elementary schools, 17 expressed interest in participation. Three of these schools were selected based on being the first schools to respond to the study, by faxing in the signatures of both the school administrator and the participating teachers. Parents of all children (N = 162) from the classes were informed of this project by a letter and were asked to give their consent for their children to participate. The letters were sent home by their classroom teacher and returned to the teacher in a sealed envelope.

Monterrey, the least populous of these urban areas, serves as the most tractable location to undertake a school-based study. In order to reduce the variance and school effects, schools were divided by socioeconomic strata. Schools in Monterrey serve children from various socioeconomic levels, depending on their location. The SES level of the schools was determined by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática (INEGI; National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Information). According to INEGI, about 70% of the population that lives in the metropolitan area of Monterrey is considered to be of a medium SES, ranked as number 6. In order to be representative, the schools were selected from a pool of schools ranked as number 6 according to the neighborhood in which they are located (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geográfica e Informática, 2006). Eligible schools were selected from a government database that identified 1,326 private and public schools in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, and of these, 601 schools had at least two classrooms at each grade 4 and 5. Eighty-five of these schools were public schools served by Gabinetes de Servicios Educativos, and 33 of these schools were from a medium SES. Eight schools were randomly selected from the 33 schools that met the inclusion criteria using the Microsoft Excel program.

The teacher gave pupils who had not returned the written consent form after a week one reminder. A total sample of 1,748 children and adolescents (856 male subjects and 892 female subjects) who were 11–14 years of age (M = 12.6, SD = 1.1, range = 10–15) returned a consent form signed by themselves and one parent or guardian.",Include: Students in Norwegian grades 6-9 (US grades 5-8) in two counties in the central region of Norway.

To obtain a sample of children disadvantaged by socioeconomic factors, the schools involved were selected by their Priority Schools FundingProgram categorization. This program identifies those schools in which the community has the highest concentrations of families disadvantaged socioeconomic factors. These schools receive specific funding from the NSW Education Department to improve student learning outcomes.From an initial pool of 1,312 year 4 and 5 children (ages 9–10),the parents of 425 children (32%) returned consent forms. Teachersgave several reminders to classes for return of consent; no additional incentives were allowed by the schools.","Year 4 and 5 children (ages 9–10)... All of the children whose parents returned their consent form (n =425) completed the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS; Reynolds and Richmond, 1978). Selection of participants for the program was modeled on Dadds et al. (1997). Those scoring above approximately the 75th percentile (a score of 18) on theRCMAS were selected for participation. Of the 111 (26%) children who scored 18 or above on the RCMAS, 4 children (3.6%) were excluded because of known behavior problems reported by the school counselor and 2 (1.8%) were excluded because of intellectual delay that would make the group’s material too difficult for them to grasp. This left a total of 105 children identified for inclusion according to scores on the RCMAS; however, resource limitations meant that not all of the children could be offered a position. Of the remaining 105 children, teachers nominated 26 (23%) of them as having significant problems with anxiety, and these children are automatically included in the research. Of the other 79 children,68 with the highest scores on the RCMAS were selected for the programand the remaining 11 were referred to the school counselor for additional help.

A total of 41 schools were randomized with one school withdrawing after randomization. Participation required written consent from the school head teacher, parents’ not opting their child out of the study, and signed assent from the child. Consent/assent involves three stages. First, eligible schools were provided with information about the study and interested head teachers were required to provide written confirmation that their school wished to participate. Second, information was posted to the home address of the parents of all eligible children. Parents were invited to return a form opting out of the study if they did not wish their child to complete the study assessments. Finally, children were provided with information about the study and were required to provide signed assent before completing a baseline assessment. Dual carer/child consent/assent was therefore required for assessment completion. The PACES cohort transitioned to secondary school in September 2013. A new opt-in recruitment process was approved for the 24-month assessment, which required signed parent and child consent. Participants received a £30 financial incentive to compensate parents and children for their time in completing the assessments.","Include: students aged 9–10 years (Years 4 and 5; US Grades 3 and 4) at state-funded junior schools in three Local Education Authorities in southwest England.

This pilot trial of the Aussie Optimism Feeling and Friends program was carried out in conjunction with the larger scale Aussie Optimism whole school intervention. The volunteer school was in the 10th lowest decile of the H-Index, a measure of socio-economic status according to the Western Australian Government Department of Education and Training (McMillan and Western, 2000).

Only one district agreed to bring the research opportunity to their district personnel for consideration (other districts declined because of calendar pressures, focus on other curricular interventions, too many changes in personnel, etc.). Thirty-five elementary school principals (K–7) in the participating large suburban school district were invited to enroll in this research project via a presentation on the research project at the school board district office in June 2004. Of the 35 elementary schools, 17 expressed interest in participation. Three of these schools were selected based on being the first schools to respond to the study, by faxing in the signatures of both the school administrator and the participating teachers. Parents of all children (N = 162) from the classes were informed of this project by a letter and were asked to give their consent for their children to participate. The letters were sent home by their classroom teacher and returned to the teacher in a sealed envelope. All children in the classroom received the program, but data were used only from children whose parents had given consent. The final sample of participants in the study consisted of 118 students (44 children did not return consent forms to participate in the study, for reasons unknown). Information sheets outlining the aims and objectives of the study and describing the prevention program, the consent forms, and the assessment instruments (i.e., BASC-PRS, MASC) were sent home to all parents via each child. The children returned the forms in a sealed envelope (provided with the package) and placed it in a bag in their classroom to be collected by the researcher.

A total of 41 urban and suburban schools received information regarding the study and an invitation to participate. Nine schools did not respond, 18 schools declined, thus leaving 18 schools willing to participate. We then sent information regarding the study to all parents of eligible children and asked them to provide written consent in order for their child to participate in the study. Information for parents was translated into seven languages to accommodate for those having a first language other than Swedish. Of the 1021 eligible children, a total of 695 (68%) agreed to participate, 91 (9%) declined, and 235 (23%) did not respond to the invitation.

The schools represented a mixture of urban and rural establishments.

The target group could include any child from P5 to S3 – age range nine years to 14 years. Initially 95 children were assessed for participation across the four schools; these children had been nominated by teachers and had received parental consent to participate should they be assigned to a FRIENDS group.","The target group could include any child from P5 to S3 – age range nine years to14 years. The criterion for inclusion in the study was one of “indicated prevention”, where children were recommended for the programme because they were deemed by their teacher(s) to indicate some signs of anxiety, low mood or low self esteem, but did not necessarily meet diagnostic criteria (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). The number who qualified for inclusion in the study was 63; however, five secondary school children who qualified for inclusion did not participate.

In many respects, the two counties provide a representative sample of the Norwegian population and are similar in sociodemographic parameters, such as geography, industry, source and level of income, age distribution, morbidity, and mortality. The population is stable, with a net emigration rate of 0.3% per annum (1996 –2000), and homogenous (less than 3% non-Caucasians; Holmen et al., 2003). Norwegian schools are highly integrated, including children with reading and behavioral difficulties as well as intellectually and physically impaired children. Initially, two selected counties—Steinkjer and Levanger in the Nord-Trøndelag province of Norway—agreed to participate in this study. The study plan was introduced to the school authorities in both counties using written materials and several meetings. After a general permission to proceed with the study was obtained, separate meetings with each school principal were held. Teachers responsible for each class were given written as well as oral instructions on how to distribute consent forms and how to conduct the assessments. Consent forms and written information describing the aim of the study were distributed to pupils by a teacher in a class session and taken home to parents/guardians. The teacher gave pupils who had not returned the written consent form after a week one reminder. A total sample of 1,748 children and adolescents (856 male subjects and 892 female subjects) who were 11–14 years of age (M = 12.6, SD = 1.1, range = 10–15) returned a consent form signed by themselves and one parent or guardian.",Include: Students in Norwegian grades 6-9 (US grades 5-8) in two counties in the central region of Norway.

The list of 268 primary schools in Bath and North East Somerset, and in Swindon and Wiltshire was compiled from Local Authority information. Project information sheets were sent to the head teachers and meetings arranged with the 45 (17%) schools who expressed interest. Four schools did not return signed letters confirming participation before randomization and were therefore excluded. A total of 41 schools were randomized with one school withdrawing after randomization. Participation required written consent from the school head teacher, parents’ not opting their child out of the study, and signed assent from the child. Consent/assent involves three stages. First, eligible schools were provided with information about the study and interested head teachers were required to provide written confirmation that their school wished to participate. Second, information was posted to the home address of the parents of all eligible children. Parents were invited to return a form opting out of the study if they did not wish their child to complete the study assessments. Finally, children were provided with information about the study and were required to provide signed assent before completing a baseline assessment. Dual carer/child consent/assent was therefore required for assessment completion. The PACES cohort transitioned to secondary school in September 2013.

The schools represented a mixture of urban and rural establishments. Teachers received a checklist describing the kinds of difficulties experienced by children in the target population – indicators of anxiety, low mood and low self esteem – and were asked to nominate children whom they felt might benefit from the programme. The target group could include any child from P5 to S3 – age range nine years to 14 years. Initially 95 children were assessed for participation across the four schools; these children had been nominated by teachers and had received parental consent to participate should they be assigned to a FRIENDS group.","The target group could include any child from P5 to S3 – age range nine years to14 years. The criterion for inclusion in the study was one of “indicated prevention”, where children were recommended for the programme because they were deemed by their teacher(s) to indicate some signs of anxiety, low mood or low self esteem, but did not necessarily meet diagnostic criteria (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). The number who qualified for inclusion in the study was 63; however, five secondary school children who qualified for inclusion did not participate. Reasons for not participating include the young person choosing not to take part in the programme or it being deemed that they would be unable to participate in a small group work environment.",58,-999,4,0.47,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,-999,Cannot tell,8-14,Range,,,3,4,5,6,7,8,,,,,,,,,Only reported Primary School,Only reported Secondary School,,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,Rural,,Urban,,,,,Cannot tell,No,Randomized trial,Individual,,,-999,-999,Cannot Tell,Rural+Urban,K-8,United Kingdom

Project information sheets were sent to the head teachers and meetings arranged with the 45 (17%) schools who expressed interest. Four schools did not return signed letters confirming participation before randomization and were therefore excluded. A total of 41 schools were randomized with one school withdrawing after randomization. Participation required written consent from the school head teacher, parents’ not opting their child out of the study, and signed assent from the child. Consent/assent involves three stages. First, eligible schools were provided with information about the study and interested head teachers were required to provide written confirmation that their school wished to participate. Second, information was posted to the home address of the parents of all eligible children. Parents were invited to return a form opting out of the study if they did not wish their child to complete the study assessments. Finally, children were provided with information about the study and were required to provide signed assent before completing a baseline assessment. Dual carer/child consent/assent was therefore required for assessment completion. The PACES cohort transitioned to secondary school in September 2013. A new opt-in recruitment process was approved for the 24-month assessment, which required signed parent and child consent. Participants received a £30 financial incentive to compensate parents and children for their time in completing the assessments.","Include: students aged 9–10 years (Years 4 and 5; US Grades 3 and 4) at state-funded junior schools in three Local Education Authorities in southwest England.
